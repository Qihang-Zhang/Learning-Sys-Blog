### Multi-Head Latent Attention

#### Standard Multi-Head Attention

$d$ is the embedding dimension of a token, $n_h$ is the number of attention heads, $d_h$ is the dimension per head, and $h_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the attention input of the $t$-th token at an attention layer. Standard MHA first produces $q_t, k_t, v_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h n_h}$ through three matrices $W^Q, W^K, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h n_h \times d}$, respectively:

$$
q_t = W^Q h_t,
$$

$$
k_t = W^K h_t,
$$

$$
v_t = W^V h_t.
$$

Then, $q_t, k_t, v_t$ will be sliced into $n_h$ heads for the multi-head attention computation:

$$
[q_{t,1}; q_{t,2}; \dots; q_{t,n_h}] = q_t,
$$

$$
[k_{t,1}; k_{t,2}; \dots; k_{t,n_h}] = k_t,
$$

$$
[v_{t,1}; v_{t,2}; \dots; v_{t,n_h}] = v_t.
$$

$$o_{t,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{t} \text{Softmax}_j \left( \frac{q_{t,i}^T k_{j,i}}{\sqrt{d_h}} \right) v_{j,i},$$

$$
u_t = W^O [o_{t,1}; o_{t,2}; \dots; o_{t,n_h}].
$$

where $q_{t,i}, k_{t,i}, v_{t,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ denote the query, key, and value of the $i$-th attention head, respectively; $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_h n_h}$ denotes the output projection matrix. During inference, all keys and values need to be cached to accelerate inference, so MHA needs to cache $2 n_h d_h$ elements for each token. In model deployment, this heavy KV cache is a large bottleneck that limits the maximum batch size and sequence length.

#### Low-Rank Key-Value Joint Compression

In [@deepseekv2], the core of MLA is the low-rank joint compression for keys and values to reduce KV cache:

$$
\mathbf{c}_t^{KV} = W^{DKV} \mathbf{h}_t, 
$$

$$
\mathbf{k}_t^C = W^{UK} \mathbf{c}_t^{KV}, 
$$

$$
\mathbf{v}_t^C = W^{UV} \mathbf{c}_t^{KV}, 
$$

where $\mathbf{c}_t^{KV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c}$ is the compressed latent vector for keys and values; $d_c (\ll d_h n_h)$ denotes the KV compression dimension; $W^{DKV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c \times d}$ is the down-projection matrix; and $W^{UK}, W^{UV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h n_h \times d_c}$ are the up-projection matrices for keys and values, respectively. 

During inference, MLA only needs to cache $\mathbf{c}_t^{KV}$, so its KV cache has only $d_c l$ elements, where $l$ denotes the number of layers.

> **In addition, during inference, since** $W^{UK}$ **can be absorbed into** $W^Q$, **and** $W^{UV}$ **can be absorbed into** $W^O$, **we even do not need to compute keys and values out for attention.** 

Moreover, in order to reduce the activation memory during training, we also perform low-rank compression for the queries, even if it cannot reduce the KV cache:

$$
\mathbf{c}_t^Q = W^{DQ} \mathbf{h}_t, 
$$

$$
\mathbf{q}_t^C = W^{UQ} \mathbf{c}_t^Q, 
$$

where $\mathbf{c}_t^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c'}$ is the compressed latent vector for queries; $d_c' (\ll d_h n_h)$ denotes the query compression dimension; and $W^{DQ} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c' \times d}$, $W^{UQ} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h n_h \times d_c'}$ are the down-projection and up-projection matrices for queries, respectively.
### Deepseek MoE
#### Basic Architecture

DeepSeekMoE has two key ideas: **segmenting experts into finer granularity** for higher expert specialization and more **accurate knowledge acquisition**, and **isolating some shared experts** for mitigating **knowledge redundancy** among routed experts. With the same number of activated and total expert parameters, DeepSeekMoE can **outperform conventional MoE architectures** like GShard by a large margin.

Let $\mathbf{u}_t$ be the FFN input of the $t$-th token, we compute the FFN output $\mathbf{h}_t'$ as follows:

$$
\mathbf{h}_t' = \mathbf{u}_t + \sum_{i=1}^{N_s} \text{FFN}_i^{(s)}(\mathbf{u}_t) + \sum_{i=1}^{N_r} g_{i,t} \text{FFN}_i^{(r)}(\mathbf{u}_t),
$$

$$
g_{i,t} = \begin{cases} 
 s_{i,t}, & s_{i,t} \in \text{Topk}({s_{j,t} | 1 \leq j \leq N_r}, K_r), \\
 0, & \text{otherwise},
 \end{cases}
$$

$$
 s_{i,t} = \text{Softmax}_i(\mathbf{u}_t^T \mathbf{e}_i),
$$

where $N_s$ and $N_r$ denote the numbers of shared experts and routed experts, respectively; $\text{FFN}_i^{(s)}(\cdot)$ and $\text{FFN}_i^{(r)}(\cdot)$ denote the $i$-th shared expert and the $i$-th routed expert, respectively; $K_r$ denotes the number of activated routed experts; $g_{i,t}$ is the gate value for the $i$-th expert; $s_{i,t}$ is the token-to-expert affinity; 

> $\mathbf{e}_i$ is the centroid of the $i$-th routed expert in this layer;

and $\text{Topk}(\cdot, K)$ denotes the set comprising $K$ highest scores among the affinity scores calculated for the $t$-th token and all routed experts.

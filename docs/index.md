Hi, this is [Qihang](https://qihang-zhang.github.io)👋. I’m documenting my learning process in this blog.

The idea of writing a Learning Blog has been on my mind for a long time. I have always been inspired by [Lil's Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/), and recently, after seeing my friend’s work on [Awesome-ML-SYS-Tutorial](https://github.com/zhaochenyang20/Awesome-ML-SYS-Tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file), I decided to start my own blog to organize my learnings, thoughts, and reflections, while also sharing insights and sparking discussions with others.

***I do believe beautiful and robust design emerges from full-chain optimization and deep integration.*** 

That’s why I’m obsessed with connecting the whole value loop. In this blog, I plan to dive into everything from machine-learning algorithms and systems to hardware tweaks, product interaction design, and even the business side that makes it all real.
